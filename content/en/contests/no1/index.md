# Mission Details 🔐

You, a special government agent and professional programmer, have been assigned a top-secret mission: to locate and retrieve a classified file that threatens national security. After numerous investigations and infiltrating several databases, you discover that the file is hidden inside a highly secure safe in an abandoned military facility.

Upon arriving at the location, you find yourself standing before the safe. An incomprehensible text is engraved on it, appearing meaningless at first glance:

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: left;"><code>NI JLIwyyx, SIO GOMN yPuFOuNy u MyLCyM Iz HOGvyLM uHx xyNyLGCHy zIL yuwB QByNByL CN CM u LCABN-wIOJFyx HOGvyL.U HOGvyL R CM wIHMCxyLyx LCABN-wIOJFyx Cz SIO wuH zCHx NQI JIMCNCPy CHNyAyLM u uHx v MOwB NBuN:0 < u ≤ v ≤ Ru × v = Ru / v ≥ 0.5cz MOwB u JuCL yRCMNM, NByH NBy HOGvyL CM LCABN-wIOJFyx uHx SIOL LyMJIHMy MBIOFx vy 1.iNByLQCMy, LyMJIHx QCNB 0.fyN’M vyACH QCNB NBy zIFFIQCHA HOGvyLM:66, 55, 120, 37</code></pre>

Your security instincts alert you: you’re dealing with a Caesar cipher with a shift of 20. The only way to unlock the safe is to decode this text and analyze the problem it conceals. By implementing the Caesar cipher algorithm and solving the problem precisely, you can find the numbers needed to open the lock. Time is running out, and the fate of the mission rests in your hands! ⏰
