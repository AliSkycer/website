summary: "In this issue, we have endeavored to provide a comprehensive overview of recent developments in artificial intelligence. Covering topics from language models to the role of hardware infrastructure and methodologies for developing intelligent systems, this edition focuses on key concepts and cutting-edge applications in the field. Additionally, our conversation with Dr. Tabarzad, a distinguished faculty member, offers a more precise perspective on AI, enriching the discourse with expert insights.\n\n\nBeyond these specialized discussions, we have also dedicated particular attention to incoming students by compiling a practical guide to help them navigate university life and its challenges. Furthermore, we have reflected the university’s perspective on our publication to give readers a clearer understanding of its significance and role within the academic community."
