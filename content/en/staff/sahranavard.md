bio: "Hello, I'm Zahra, a curious Software Engineering student. With immense enthusiasm, I dedicate most of my time to learning new skills and challenging myself. I deeply believe that in the boundless world of technology, there's no finish line or point to stop learning!\n\n\nIn general, my life is divided into two parts: artistic and technical. My graphic designs represent the artistic aspect of my life, allowing me to see the world colorfully and passionately visualize my ideas. Similarly, the intersection between my long-standing interest and my field of study has opened my path to the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Deep Learning, as a result, the majority of my activities are focused in this area.\n\n\n I believe that the combination of science, technology, and art, along with out-of-the-box thinking, can transform the world into a better place :)"
